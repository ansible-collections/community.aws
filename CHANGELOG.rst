The community.aws collection has dropped support for ``botocore<1.25.0`` and ``boto3<1.22.0``.
Support for Python 3.6 has also been dropped.


Minor Changes
-------------

- The ``black`` code formatter has been run across the collection to improve code consistency (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/1784).
- aws_config_delivery_channel - add support for encrypted objects in S3 via KMS key (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/1786).
- aws_ssm - Updated the documentation to explicitly mention that the ``ansible_user`` and ``remote_user`` variables are not supported by the plugin (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/1682).
- bulk migration of ``%`` and ``.format()`` to fstrings (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/1810).

- cloudfront_distribution - add ``origin_shield`` options (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/1557).
- cloudfront_distribution - documented ``connection_attempts`` and ``connection_timeout`` the module was already capable of using them
- community.aws - updated document fragments based on changes in amazon.aws (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/1738).
- community.aws - updated imports based on changes in amazon.aws (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/1738).

- wafv2_rule_group_info - remove unused and deprecated ``state`` parameter (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/1555).

Breaking Changes / Porting Guide
--------------------------------

- The community.aws collection has dropped support for ``botocore<1.25.0`` and ``boto3<1.22.0``. Most modules will continue to work with older versions of the AWS SDK, however compatability with older versions of the SDK is not guaranteed and will not be tested. When using older versions of the SDK a warning will be emitted by Ansible (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/1743).
- aws_ssm - the AWS SSM plugin was incorrectly prepending ``sudo`` to most commands.  This behaviour was incorrect and has been removed. To execute commands as a specific user, including the ``root`` user, the ``become`` and ``become_user`` directives should be used.  See the `Ansible documentation for more information <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_privilege_escalation.html>`_ (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/issues/853).
- codebuild_project - ``tags`` parameter now accepts a dict representing the tags, rather than the boto3 format (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/1643).

Deprecated Features
-------------------

- community.aws collection - due to the AWS SDKs Python support policies (https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/python-support-policy-updates-for-aws-sdks-and-tools/) support for Python less than 3.8 by this collection is expected to be removed in a release after 2024-12-01 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/1743).
- community.aws collection - due to the AWS SDKs announcing the end of support for Python less than 3.7 (https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/python-support-policy-updates-for-aws-sdks-and-tools/) support for Python less than 3.7 by this collection has been deprecated and will be removed in release 7.0.0. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/1743).

Bugfixes
--------

- opensearch_info - Fix the name of the domain_name key in the example (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/1811).

Breaking Changes / Porting Guide
--------------------------------

- Tags beginning with ``aws:`` will not be removed when purging tags, these tags are reserved by Amazon and may not be updated or deleted (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/issues/817).
- aws_secret - tags are no longer removed when the ``tags`` parameter is not set.  To remove all tags set ``tags={}`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/issues/1146).
- community.aws collection - The ``community.aws`` collection has now dropped support for and any requirements upon the original ``boto`` AWS SDK, and now uses the ``boto3``/``botocore`` AWS SDK (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/898).
- community.aws collection - the ``profile`` parameter is now mutually exclusive with the ``aws_access_key``, ``aws_secret_key`` and ``security_token`` parameters (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/834).
- ec2_vpc_route_table - The module has been migrated from the ``community.aws`` collection. Playbooks using the Fully Qualified Collection Name for this module should be updated to use ``amazon.aws.ec2_vpc_route_table``.
- ec2_vpc_route_table_info - The module has been migrated from the ``community.aws`` collection. Playbooks using the Fully Qualified Collection Name for this module should be updated to use ``amazon.aws.ec2_vpc_route_table_info``.
- elb_instance - the ``ec2_elbs`` fact has been removed, ``updated_elbs`` has been added the return values and includes the same information (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/1173).
- elb_network_lb - the default value of ``state`` has changed from ``absent`` to ``present`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/1167).
- script_inventory_ec2 - The ec2.py inventory script has been moved to a new repository. The script can now be downloaded from https://github.com/ansible-community/contrib-scripts/blob/main/inventory/ec2.py and has been removed from this collection. We recommend migrating from the script to the amazon.aws.ec2 inventory plugin.  (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/898)

- efs_tag - ``resource_tags`` has been added as an alias for the ``tags`` parameter (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/1184).
- rds_instance - add snapshot tests to test suite to test restoring db from snapshot (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/1081).
- rds_instance_info - add retries on common AWS failures (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/1026).
- wafv2_web_acl - relax botocore requirement to bare minimum required (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/1216).

Deprecated Features
-------------------

- aws_codebuild - The ``tags`` parameter currently uses a non-standard format and has been deprecated.  In release 6.0.0 this parameter will accept a simple key/value pair dictionary instead of the current list of dictionaries.  It is recommended to migrate to using the resource_tags parameter which already accepts the simple dictionary format (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/1221).
- route53_info - The CamelCase return values for ``HostedZones``, ``ResourceRecordSets``, and ``HealthChecks`` have been deprecated, in the future release you must use snake_case return values ``hosted_zones``, ``resource_record_sets``, and ``health_checks`` instead respectively.

Bugfixes
--------

- aws_codebuild - fix bug where the result may be spuriously flagged as ``changed`` when multiple tags were set on the project (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/1221).
- ecs_service - fix broken change detect of ``health_check_grace_period_seconds`` parameter when not specified (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/1212).

- lambda_info - fix bug that forces query=config when getting info for all lambdas. Now, if function name is specified, query will default to all.  This may have a performance impact when querying a large number of lambdas. If function name is not specified, query will default to config (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/1152).
- rds_instance - fix bugs associated with restoring db instance from snapshot (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/1081).
- wafv2_ip_set - fix bug where incorrect changed state was returned when only changing the description (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/1211).
