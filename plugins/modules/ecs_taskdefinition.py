    Used to determine if an existing ECS task definition already satisfies the
    user's requested configuration, so a new revision can be skipped.

    Rules:
      - Every truthy value in left must equal the corresponding value in right.
      - Falsy values in left (0, "", [], None) are ignored — treated as "not specified".
      - Extra truthy keys in right that are absent from left cause a mismatch,
        EXCEPT ``essential: True`` which is an ECS default.
      - Extra falsy keys in right are ignored.
      - List values are compared order-independently (ECS may reorder them).
        Both lists must have the same length and every element in left must
        appear in right.
      - For port-mapping dicts missing a ``protocol`` key, ``protocol: "tcp"``
        is filled in before comparison (the ECS default).
