The Ansible Community AWS collection includes a variety of Ansible content to help automate the management of AWS instances. This collection is maintained by the Ansible community.

## Included content

Click the ``Content`` button to see the list of content included in this collection.

## Installing this collection

You can install the AWS collection with the Ansible Galaxy CLI:

    ansible-galaxy collection install community.aws

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it with `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml`, using the format:

```yaml
---
collections:
  - name: community.aws
    version: 0.1.1
```
## Using this collection


You can either call modules by their Fully Qualified Collection Namespace (FQCN), such as `community.aws.ec2_instance`, or you can call modules by their short name if you list the `community.aws` collection in the playbook's `collections` keyword:

```yaml
---
  - name: Create a DB instance using the default AWS KMS encryption key
    community.aws.rds_instance:
      id: test-encrypted-db
      state: present
      engine: mariadb
      storage_encrypted: True
      db_instance_class: db.t2.medium
      username: "{{ username }}"
      password: "{{ password }}"
      allocated_storage: "{{ allocated_storage }}"

```
