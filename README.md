# Community AWS Collection

The Ansible Community AWS collection includes a variety of Ansible content to help automate the management of AWS services. This collection is maintained by the Ansible community.

AWS related modules and plugins supported by the Ansible Cloud team are in the [amazon.aws](https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws) collection.

## Ansible version compatibility

Tested with the Ansible Core >= 2.12.0 versions, and the current development version of Ansible. Ansible Core versions before 2.12.0 are not supported.

Use community.aws 4.x.y if you are using Ansible 2.9 or Ansible Core 2.10.

## Python version compatibility

This collection depends on the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3 and Botocore).  Due to the
[AWS SDK Python Support Policy](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/python-support-policy-updates-for-aws-sdks-and-tools/)
this collection requires Python 3.7 or greater.

Amazon have also announced the planned end of support for
[Python less than 3.8](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/python-support-policy-updates-for-aws-sdks-and-tools/).
As such support for Python less than 3.8 will be removed in a release after 2024-12-01.

## AWS SDK version compatibility

Starting with the 2.0.0 releases of amazon.aws and community.aws, it is generally the collection's policy to support the versions of `botocore` and `boto3` that were released 12 months prior to the most recent major collection release, following semantic versioning (for example, 2.0.0, 3.0.0).

Version 7.0.0 of this collection supports `boto3 >= 1.26.0` and `botocore >= 1.29.0`

All support for the original AWS SDK `boto` was removed in release 4.0.0.

## Installing this collection

You can install the AWS collection with the Ansible Galaxy CLI:

    ansible-galaxy collection install community.aws

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it with `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml`, using the format:

```yaml
---
collections:
  - name: community.aws

```

A specific version of the collection can be installed by using the `version` keyword in the `requirements.yml` file:

```yaml
---
collections:
  - name: community.aws
    version: 3.1.1
```

The python module dependencies are not installed by `ansible-galaxy`.  They can
be manually installed using pip:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

or:

    pip install boto3 botocore

## Using this collection

You can either call modules by their Fully Qualified Collection Name (FQCN), such as `community.aws.ec2_instance`, or you can call modules by their short name if you list the `community.aws` collection in the playbook's `collections` keyword:

```yaml
---
  - name: Create a DB instance using the default AWS KMS encryption key
    community.aws.rds_instance:
      id: test-encrypted-db
      state: present
      engine: mariadb
      storage_encrypted: True
      db_instance_class: db.t2.medium
      username: "{{ username }}"
      password: "{{ password }}"
      allocated_storage: "{{ allocated_storage }}"

```
