breaking_changes:
- script_inventory_ec2 - The ec2.py inventory script has been moved to a new repository.
  The script can now be downloaded from https://github.com/ansible-community/contrib-scripts/blob/main/inventory/ec2.py and has been removed from this collection.
  We recommend migrating from the script to the amazon.aws.ec2 inventory plugin.  (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/898)
- community.aws collection - The ``community.aws`` collection has now dropped support for and any requirements upon the original ``boto`` AWS SDK, and now uses the ``boto3``/``botocore`` AWS SDK
  (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/898).
