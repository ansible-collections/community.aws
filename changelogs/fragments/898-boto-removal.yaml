breaking_changes:
- The ec2.py inventory script has been moved to a new repository.
  The script can now be downloaded from https://github.com/ansible-community/contrib-scripts/blob/main/inventory/ec2.py and has been removed from this collection.
  We recommend migrating from the script to the amazon.aws.ec2 inventory plugin.
