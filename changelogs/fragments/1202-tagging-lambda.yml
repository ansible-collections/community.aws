bugfixes:
- lambda - fix bug where the lambda module was modifying tags in check mode (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/1202).
- lambda - fix bug where tag keys were mangled in the return values (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/1202).
minor_changes:
- lambda - ``resource_tags`` has been added as an alias for the ``tags`` parameter (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/1202).
- lambda - the behavior for ``tags`` has been updated, to remove all tags the ``tags`` parameter must be explicitly set to the empty dict ``{}`` and ``purge_tags`` to ``True`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/1202).
