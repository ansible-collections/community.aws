minor_changes:
- ec2_snapshot_copy - ``resource_tags`` has been added as an alias for the ``tags`` parameter (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/1201).
- ec2_snapshot_copy - updated to pass tags as part of the copy API call rather than tagging the snapshot after creation (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/1201).
