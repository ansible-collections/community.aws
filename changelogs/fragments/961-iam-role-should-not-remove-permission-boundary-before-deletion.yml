bugfixes:
  - Removes unnecessary removal of permission boundary from a role when deleting a role. Unlike inline policies, permission boundaries do not need to be removed from an IAM role before deleting the IAM role. This behavior causes issues when a permission boundary is inherited that prevents removal of the permission boundary. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/961)
