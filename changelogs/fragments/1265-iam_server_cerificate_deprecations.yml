breaking_changes:
- iam_server_certificate - Passing file names to the ``cert``, ``chain_cert``
  and ``key`` parameters has been removed. We recommend using a lookup plugin
  to read the files instead, see the documentation for an example
  (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/1265).
- iam_server_certificate - the default value for the ``dup_ok`` parameter has
  been changed to ``true``. To preserve the original behaviour explicitly set
  the ``dup_ok`` parameter to ``false``
  (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/1265).
