minor_changes:
- lambda_info - add return key ``lambda_info`` which returns a list of dictionaries instead of the previously returned
  ``function``, which returned a dictionary of dictionaries (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/1239).
- lambda_info - now returns basic configuration information of each lambda, regardless of query (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/1239).

deprecated_features:
- lambda_info - The ``function`` return key returns a dictionary of dictionaries and has been deprecated. In release 6.0.0 this module will instead
  return ``lambda_info`` which returns a list of dictionaries (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/1239).
