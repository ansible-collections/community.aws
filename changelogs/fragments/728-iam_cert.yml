deprecated_features:
- iam_cert - the iam_cert module has been renamed to iam_server_certificate for consistency with the companion iam_server_certificate_info module.
  The usage of the module has not changed.  The iam_cert alias will be removed in version 4.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/728).
