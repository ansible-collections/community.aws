minor_changes:
- dynamodb_table - the module has been updated to use the boto3 AWS SDK (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/726).
deprecated_features:
- dynamodb_table - DynamoDB does not support updating the primary indexes on a table.  Attempts to make such changes are currently ignored but will result in failures after version 3.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/726).
- dynamodb_table - DynamoDB does not support specifying non-key-attributes when creating an ``ALL`` index.  Passing ``includes`` for such indexes is currently ignored but will result in failures after version 3.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/726).
