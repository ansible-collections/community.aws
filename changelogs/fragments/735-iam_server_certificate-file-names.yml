deprecated_features:
- iam_server_certificate - Passing file names to the ``cert``, ``chain_cert`` and ``key`` parameters has been deprecated.
  We recommend using a lookup plugin to read the files instead, see the documentation for an example (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/pull/735).
