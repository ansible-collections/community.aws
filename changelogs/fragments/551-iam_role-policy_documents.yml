minor_changes:
- iam_role - added ``assume_role_policy_document_raw`` to the role return values, this doesn't convert policy document contents from CamelCase to snake_case (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/issues/551).
- iam_role_info - added ``assume_role_policy_document_raw`` to the role return values, this doesn't convert policy document contents from CamelCase to snake_case (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/issues/551).
deprecated_features:
- iam_role - All top level return values other than ``iam_role`` and ``changed`` have been deprecated and will be removed in a release after 2023-12-01 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/issues/551).
- iam_role - In a release after 2023-12-01 the contents of ``assume_role_policy_document`` will no longer be converted from CamelCase to snake_case.  The ``assume_role_policy_document_raw`` return value already returns the policy document in this future format (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/issues/551).
- iam_role_info - In a release after 2023-12-01 the contents of ``assume_role_policy_document`` will no longer be converted from CamelCase to snake_case.  The ``assume_role_policy_document_raw`` return value already returns the policy document in this future format (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/issues/551).
