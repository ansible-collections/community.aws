# These tests work on rule sets without making them active.
# so multiple builds can safely run these tests as is normal.
#
# DO NOT ADD TESTS THAT RELY ON ACTIVE RULE SETS TO THIS FILE
#
# Any test that make rule sets active must be added in
# active-rule-set-tests.yaml or you will have intermittent failures
# from multiple builds interacting
